# About MyExpenseBot/category Feature
This feature enables the user to manage their categories.
Currently we have the following expense categories set by default:

- Food

- Transport

- Miscellaneous

The user can choose to add/delete/show categories, and after that, add the cost with custom category to the expense tracker.
