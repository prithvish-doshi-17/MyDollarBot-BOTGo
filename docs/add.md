2. post_type_selection(message, bot):
 It takes 2 arguments for processing - **message** which is the message from the user, and **bot** which is the telegram bot object from the run(message, bot): function in the add.py file.

 It takes 3 arguments for processing - **message** which is the message from the user, **bot** which is the telegram bot object, **selectedType** which is the type selected in between income and expense from the post_type_selection(message, bot): function in the add.py file. It stores the category selected from post_type_selection(message, bot) and requests the user to select the type of currency from the menu and then passes control to post_currency_input(message, bot, selectedType, selected_category) for further processing.

It stores the type of currency and requests the user to enter the amount they have spent on the income or expense category chosen and then passes control to post_amount_input(message, bot, selectedType, selected_category, converted_currency) for further processing.

5. post_amount_input(message, bot, selectedType, selected_category, converted_currency):

It takes the amount entered by the user and validates it with helper.validate_entered_amount() and pop ups a calendar for user to take income or expense date input from the user and then passes control to post_date_input(message, date_entered, bot, selectedType, selected_category, converted_currency, amount_value) for further processing.

It takes the date selected by the user using calendar and validated it with helper.validate_selected_date() and converts the amount input from the input currency type to default type i.e., USD and then calls add_user_income_record or add_user_expense_record based on the selectedType to store the data.
